### Abstract
With increased urbanization, habitat degradation, and climate change, wild animals are resorting to riskier behaviors, such as foraging on human-provided food resources. While human-centric (HC) foraging may require less immediate effort and energy from wildlife, interactions with humans can yield profound negative consequences, including injury, health risks, and behavior changes that reduce fitness. In Sarasota Bay, Florida, some members of the long-term resident bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) community engage in HC foraging, especially following environmental changes, such as intense harmful algal blooms (HAB) that deplete natural prey. Here, I model how varying levels of human interaction with dolphinsâ€™ foraging behaviors influence their social network structure and evaluate correlations among behavior changes and HABs. Using Bayesian inference and network analysis on a 20-yr dataset of the Sarasota dolphin community, I compared the network positions of dolphins that engaged in human-centric tactics to those using only natural foraging tactics. I found that the type of human-centric behavior had different effects on sociality, with more direct, risky interactions with humans causing individuals to become less connected with others, while human-centric foraging away from humans, potentially more profitable, increased sociality. These findings have implications for understanding the long-term impact of human interaction on the social cohesion of wildlife communities.
